Machine Learning Projects using Python 

This repository contains 3 machine learning projects (so far)

1. Supervised learning classification model predicting whether or not a patient has heart disesase based on several variables, using scikitlearn and other python packages in jupyter notebook.
   
2. Supervised learning regression model with time series data creating a model to predict the price of bulldozers based on several predictor variables, using scikitlearn in jupyter notebook.

3. Deep learning neural network project, creating a model to predict the breed of a dog based on a picture, using tensorflow and keras within a google colab notebook.
